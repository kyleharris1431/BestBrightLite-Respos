=====================
Okay, this is BestBrightLight.

What is on github is just a general idea of what it may look like. Any changes to the layout & content can be made. 
I don't care, just make sure it is an improvement. Over the last.

Anyways this is written on an HTML 5/CSS3 template with php & javacript worked into it. As it sits now, it runs on a local
server that runs MAMP, obviously WAMP and LAMP will work too. Just download an apache build and put the contents 
of the "htdocs" folder in your server root which is probably also named "htdocs" and your good to go.
